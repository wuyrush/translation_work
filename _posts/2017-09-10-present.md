让我怎么说 我不知道

How to put it? I have no idea

太多的语言 消失在胸口

I’ve got too much to say, but they all gone in my heart	

头顶的蓝天 沉默高远

The blue tranquil sky is so far away

有你在身边 让我感到安详

Having you by my side makes me feel deep in peace

走不完的路 望不尽的天涯

What a long journey, what a long life

在燃烧的岁月 在漫长的等待

Time flies. What a long wait

当心中的欢乐 在一瞬间开启

When happiness blossom in my heart at that moment

我想有你在身边 与你一起分享

I’d like you by my side, sharing such happiness

让我怎么说 我不知道

How to put it? I have no idea

太多的语言 消失在胸口

I’ve got too much to say, but they all gone in my heart	

头顶的蓝天 沉默高远

The blue tranquil sky is so far away

有你在身边 让我感到安详

Having you by my side makes me feel deep in peace

在寂静的夜 曾经为你祈祷

In peaceful nights, I used to pray for you

希望自己是 你生命中的礼物

Hoping that I can be the present in your life

当心中的欢乐 在一瞬间开启

When happiness blossom in my heart at that moment

我想有你在身边 与你一起分享

I would like you by my side, sharing such happiness

走不完的路 望不尽的天涯

What a long journey, what a long life

在燃烧的岁月 在漫长的等待

Time flies. What a long wait

当心中的欢乐 在一瞬间开启

When happiness blossom in my heart at that moment

我想有你在身边 与你一起分享

I would like you by my side, sharing such happiness

在寂静的夜 曾经为你祈祷

In peaceful nights, I used to pray for you

希望自己是 你生命中的礼物

Hoping that I can be the present in your life

当心中的欢乐 在一瞬间开启

When happiness blossom in my heart at that moment

我想有你在身边 与你一起分享

I would like you by my side, sharing such happiness

让我怎么说 我不知道

How to put it? I don’t know

太多的语言 消失在胸口

I’ve got too much to say, but they all gone in my heart	

头顶的蓝天 沉默高远

The blue tranquil sky is so far away

有你在身边 让我感到安详

Having you by my side makes me feel deep, deep in peace.
